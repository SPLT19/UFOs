## Summary

- Analysis and drawbacks
As seen above the current Webpage can receive input and filter using different criteria to retrieve useful information regarding UFO reports. Despite achieved results, further improvements could be held up. 
The filtering input only allows precise name to retrieve the information, meaning the use of the same word with different characters codes throwback error, for example in the case of lower and upper cases. 

As seen in powerful research engines, that allow and suggest words close to the intended input is not supported with the current version. This could hindrance searching and not be as friendly as it is for instance in more powerful search engines. 

This is not only the case with the words and names but stand also for the dates. It has to be in the format that the information is stored, or it wouldnâ€™t retrieve information.

- Recommendation for further versions
As stated, before different implementations could be made in order to help users find the information like, allowing upper and lower letters, or other special symbols, or word suggestions the closest able option in the dataset. 

Another improvement could be to include other characteristics of UFO reports that might be of interest like linking to references of the information, pictures or the encounters or different visualisation characteristics like double page reading or forum to interact with people with similar interest and perhaps more sources of information. 

 Lastly in order to improve the page to something that users interested in UFO might find more appealing, polls could be send to get feedback about the current Webpage that could allow a more refined and friendly interface for UFO investigation interested population. Instead of assuming changes, a further interaction with users of the engine using polls or opening a suggestion box might come in handy to evolve and improve the webpage design and smoother appealing user interaction.
